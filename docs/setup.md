# Setting up a new machine

Most of the work happens elsewhere: Netlify builds and deploys the website, and GitHub
Actions tests the Mac app and uploads it to the App Store. A new machine only needs enough
to run the site and the app locally.

## The website

You need Git and Node 24 (the version in `.nvmrc`; anything from 20.19 works).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:salemhilal/sequence.photos.git
cd sequence.photos
nvm install      # or: brew install node@24
npm install
npm run dev      # → http://localhost:5173 (the landing page; the app is at /app/)
npm test
```

That's all the website needs. The site's domain and App Store link are set in `.env`, which
is checked in.

## The Mac app

On a Mac (macOS 13 or later), you also need:

1. **The Xcode Command Line Tools**, for the compiler and code signing:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. **Rust**, from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) (1.90 or later):
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   The installer adds `~/.cargo/bin` to your shell's `PATH`; open a new terminal after it
   finishes (`cargo --version` should work). If `npm run app` says it can't find `cargo`,
   add this to `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
   ```

Then:

```bash
npm run app        # run it, reloading on changes (the first build takes a few minutes)
npm run test:app   # the end-to-end test: open, save, relaunch, and sandboxed
npm run build:app  # a local build → src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/
```

Local builds are ad-hoc signed and sandboxed like the App Store's, so they need no Apple
account or certificates.

## Releasing

Nothing to set up. Releases come from GitHub:

- **Website:** every push to `main` deploys to sequence.photos (Netlify). Pull requests get
  a preview deploy.
- **Mac app:** bump the version (in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`,
  `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`), push to
  `main`, and publish a GitHub release tagged `v` + that version (e.g. `v0.1.2`). The
  **App Store** workflow tests the app, builds it, signs it, and uploads it to App Store
  Connect, where you pick the build and submit it for review.

The signing certificates, provisioning profile, and App Store Connect API key live in the
repo's Actions secrets (the workflow's header lists them), not on any machine.

### Building for the App Store locally (optional)

Only needed to upload without GitHub, with `npm run app:store`. It needs:

- **Full Xcode** (from the App Store), for the upload tool. The Command Line Tools aren't
  enough.
- **The Apple Distribution and Mac Installer Distribution certificates** in your keychain.
  Get them from Xcode → Settings → Accounts → Manage Certificates.
- **The app's Mac App Store provisioning profile**, downloaded from developer.apple.com →
  Profiles, saved as `src-tauri/embedded.provisionprofile`. It's kept out of Git.
- **An App Store Connect API key**, to upload as well as build: set
  `APP_STORE_API_KEY_ID`, `APP_STORE_API_ISSUER`, and `APP_STORE_API_KEY_PATH`. Without
  one, it builds the `.pkg` for you to upload with Transporter.

The script says what's missing.
